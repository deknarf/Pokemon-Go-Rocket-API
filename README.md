## Transfer Types

The most popular option is probably the duplicate type that removes all duplicates and leaves you one pokemon of each type with the highest CP.

* none - disables transferring
* cp - transfers all pokemon below the CP threshold in the app.config, EXCEPT for those types specified in program.cs in TransferAllWeakPokemon
* leaveStrongest - transfers all but the highest CP pokemon of each type SPECIFIED IN program.cs in TransferAllButStrongestUnwantedPokemon (those that aren't specified are untouched)
* duplicate - same as above but for all pokemon (no need to specify type)
* all - transfers all pokemon

## Defining the use of PoKÃ©Balls (Advanced)

Go to Client.cs and find the following code:

       if (masterBallsCount > 0)
        return MiscEnums.Item.ITEM_MASTER_BALL;

       if (ultraBallsCount > 0)
        return MiscEnums.Item.ITEM_ULTRA_BALL;

       if (greatBallsCount > 0)
        return MiscEnums.Item.ITEM_GREAT_BALL;

       return MiscEnums.Item.ITEM_POKE_BALL;

Change the value after the " > " to ignore the specific Ball, until value exceeds set amount.
For example, if you want to keep 20 Great Balls and start using them when you have 21:

       if (greatBallsCount > 20)
        return MiscEnums.Item.ITEM_GREAT_BALL;
